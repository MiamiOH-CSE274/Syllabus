Catalog description
-------------------
Abstract data types and their implementation as data structures using object-oriented programming. Use of object-oriented principles in the selection and analysis of various ADT implementations. Sequential and linked storage representations: lists, stacks, queues, and tables. Nonlinear data structures: trees and graphs. Recursion, sorting, searching, and algorithm complexity.

Prerequisite: Either (CSE271 (with C-or above) and MTH 231) or (CSE271 (with C-or above) and MTH 222, MTH 251, and ECE 287).

Miami Plan
----------
CSE274 is a third-tier course in the CSE "Computer Programming" thematic sequence. See http://www.units.muohio.edu/reg/bulletins/GeneralBulletin2012-2013/cse-2-computer-programming.htm

Sources of instruction
----------------------
Required text: Will be provided free online. See homework assignments for assigned readings.

Meetings: MW 8:30a-9:50a, in Benton 002.

Website: We will use Github as our primary means of distributing course materials. We will use Niihka for updates, tips, links, and so on. Please check Niihka regularly!

Grading
-------
I will use the standard CSE grading criteria in this course: 

* A: Complete mastery of essential topics
* B: Very good knowledge of essential topics
* C: Knowledge of essential topics, but some recognizable deficiencies
* D: Some familiarity with essential topics, but major areas of deficiency
* F: Seriously incomplete work or little evidence of knowledge of course topics

I do give +/- grades as appropriate.

The value of the course work will be divided as follows: 

* Tests (50%)	
 * Test 1	15%	
 * Test 2	15%	
 * Final	20%
* Course portfolio (50%)
 * See https://github.com/MiamiOH-CSE274/Portfolio

Due dates: All homework assignments and programming projects are due by midnight on the due date.

Homework is to be submitted via pull request on github: I will accept your most recent pull request, and grade whatever is in your branch, at the time the assignment is due. I will only grade material that is references in your Portfolio, so be sure to update that, and send a pull request, as well.

Late work: Credit will not be given for late work, except in unexpected emergencies such as the death of a loved one or personal injury. Exams may also be rescheduled to accommodate religious observance. In any of these cases the student must contact me before the assignment due date (or exam date) if it is possible to do so. In every case the student should be prepared to provide appropriate documentation. 

Always back up your electronic work! Computer/network failures are a fact of life. One reason to use github religiously is to help guard against personal computer failures. 

Exams: Exams 1 and 2 will take place during class. No outside materials are allowed during exams: This includes (but is not limited to) books, notes, calculators and food, unless otherwise specified by me.

Programming Assignments: There will be take home assignments where the goal is to design and implement a computer program in the assigned programming language (C++) to solve a specific problem. All programming assignments are open source (more on this below). The following grading criteria will be used to evaluate the quality of most of your programs:

* Basic requirements
 * Program compiles: Non-compiling programs receive a 0
 * Following specifications: Programs that fail to follow directions or do not implement the minimum level of functionality receive a 0
 * README.md: You must document carefully which parts of your program work and do not work in your README.md. Programs submitted without a README.md, or with a misleading or unhelpful one, will receive a 0.
 * Project video: Because of the open-ended nature of the projects it is impossible for me to automate grading. Therefore, for every project you must post a short video demo of your project on YouTube. You should discuss what you intended to do, why, what you actually accomplished, what went right, what went wrong, which parts of the code you wrote yourself, and what you got help on. You must include the link to the video in your README.md. You must also do this for labs if you plan to use the lab in your project portfolio.
* Content requirements
 * Program accuracy and robustness
 * Program design
 * Testing adequacy
 * Analysis (if required)

You will write fairly large programs during this semester, so expect to invest a considerable amount of time to correctly complete each program. Mastery of programming is directly proportional to time spent programming. 

Conduct policy
-------------- 
The primary responsibility of a college professor is to create an environment in which all students have an equal opportunity to learn and succeed. For this reason, this course has a zero tolerance policy for both discrimination and academic misconduct. Appropriate definitions may be found in the student handbook. Violators of these policies will not receive warning: I will immediately report violations and seek the appropriate penalty for any such infraction. You must read and understand the CSE department expectations for Academic Integrity, http://www.eas.muohio.edu/fileadmin/departments/csa/downloads/AcademicIntegrity.pdf

Group work policy: In order to facilitate learning, students are encouraged to use github to look at and discuss each other's code. Copying a solution is not, however, the same as "discussing." Because of the creative nature of all assignments in this course, it is very obvious when outright copying has taken place.

You are allowed to help each other find bugs, and are encouraged to code review with each other, even when it is not required by the assignment. There is one cardinal rule: Do not type any code into someone else's repository. When collaborating, you must always use the "fork-->fix-->pull request" functionality of github to share code. This allows me to easily see who wrote what, using the "blame" feature of git, and protects you against accusations of cheating.

Attributions
------------ 
Portions of this document were written by Bo Brinkman, Mike Helmick, Al Sanders, and the staff of Miami's CSE Department.

Learning outcomes
-----------------
Learning outcomes form the "specification" for this course. You are not expected to know the learning outcomes, but they are provided to help you understand what we plan to do, and why we are doing it. To save paper, the outcomes are not listed here, but they are posted on the CSE department web page, under "course descriptions." You will also be taking a survey on the first day of class that will familiarize you with the learning outcomes of the course.

Github and copyright
--------------------
In this course you will be asked to post your code publicly on github. You will NOT be required to release your code under an open-source license. This means you do not lose any of your other copyrights to your work, unless you choose to include an open-source license in your source code files. Do NOT copy my copyright language from my source code without thinking it through first!

Github and privacy
------------------
In this course you will be asked to post your code publicly on github, and publicly post project reports on YouTube. You have the right, under the FERPA law, to refuse this. Students that agree will need to sign a FERPA release, saying that you agree to post your code publicly, and that you agree to allow other students in the class to publicly post comments/critiques of your code. I (the instructor) will NOT post any grades or critiques of your code publicly. Also, you may delete your public repository as soon as grading and peer-evaluation activities have been completed.

Students that refuse to sign the FERPA release will need to use alternative methods for evaluation, and for the peer-review assignments. Students that do not sign the FERPA release will need to meet with me to select an appropriate alternative. This will not affect your grade in any way, but it will mean that you do not learn how to use github.
